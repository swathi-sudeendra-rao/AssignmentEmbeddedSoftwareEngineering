This project presents the utilization of the control theory approach “Bilateral control” for robot manipulation in medical field specifically in surgical operations. This application like any other in these modern technological days will rely on an embedded system for implementation. In order to deliver such complex system accurately and efficiently, we had to model and design the system to know all the requirements, make the system more understandable and ensure maintainability.
